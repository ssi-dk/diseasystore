* This is a new release.

This is re-upload following comments from the CRAN team.
* back ticks in the Description have been replaced with undirected single-quotes

* The pre-checks flagged some malformed formatting in the file `FeatureHandler.Rd`.
  These are now changed so no errors should be produced
