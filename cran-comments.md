## Message for CRAN team

Dear team

I see that current CRAN Checks for this package fails on r-oldrel-macos-x86_64.
(It seems a memory issue is evoked here).

I do not have access to this hardware to investigate the error. 
Do you require a fix for this when no errors are thrown for r-release-macos-x86_64?
