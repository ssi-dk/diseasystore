This vignette gives you the knowledge you need to create your own `diseasystore`.

# The diseasy data model
To begin, we go through the data model used within the `diseasystores`.
It is this data models that enables the automatic coupling of features and powers the package.

## A bitemporal data model
The data created by `diseasystores` are so-called "bitemporal" data.
This means we have two temporal dimensions.
One representing the validity of the record, and one representing the availability of the record.

### `valid_from` and `valid_until`
The validity dimension indicates when a given data point is "valid", e.g. a hospitalisation is valid between admission
and discharge date.
This temporal dimension should be familiar to you is simply "regular" time.

We encode the validity information into the columns `valid_from` and `valid_until` such that a record is valid for any
time `t` which satisfies `valid_from <= t < valid_until`.
For many features, the validity is a single day (such as a test result) and the `valid_until` column will be the day
after `valid_from`.

By convention, we place these column as the last columns of the table[^1].

### `from_ts` and `until_ts`
`diseasystore` uses `{SCDB}` in the background to store the computed features.
`SCDB` implements the second temporal dimension which indicates when a record was present in the data.
This information is encoded in the columns `from_ts` and `until_ts`.
Normally, you don't see these columns when working with `diseasystore` since they are masked by `SCDB`.
However, if you inspect the tables crated in the data base by `diseasystore`, you will find they are present.
For our purposes, it is sufficient to know that these column gives a time-versioned data base where we can extract
previous versions through the `slice_ts` argument.
By supplying any time `Ï„` as `slice_ts`, we get the data as they were available on that date.
This allows us to build continuous integration of our features while preserving previously computed features.


## Automatic data-coupling
A primary feature of `diseasystore` is its ability to automatically couple and aggregate features.
This coupling requires common "key_\*" columns between the features.
Any feature in a `diseasystore` therefore must have at least one "key_\*" column.
By convention, we place these column as the first columns of the table.

## Features
Finally, we come to the main data of the `diseasystore`, namely the features.
First, a reminder that "feature" here comes from machine learning and is any individual piece of information.

We subdivide features into two categories: "observables" and "stratifications".
On most levels, these are indistinguishable, but their purposes differ and hence we need to handle them individually.

### Observables
In `diseasystore` any feature whose name either starts with "n_" or ends with "_temperature" are treated as
"observables".
From a modelling perspective, these observables are typically the metrics you want to model or take as inputs to inform
your model.

### Stratifications
Conversely, any other feature is a "stratification" feature.
These features are the variables used to subdivide your analysis to match the structure of your model
(hence why they are called stratification features).

A prominent example for most disease models would be a stratification feature like "age_group", since most diseases
show a strong dependency on the age of the affected individuals.

### Naming convention
While there is no formal requirement for the naming of the observables or stratifications, it is considered best
practice to use the same names as other `diseasystores` for features where possible[^2].
This simplifies the process of adapting analyses and disease models to new `diseasystores`.

# Creating FeatureHandlers
To facilitate the automatic coupling and aggregation of features, we use the `?FeatureHandler` class.
Each feature[^3] in the `diseasystore` has an associated `FeatureHandler` which implements the computation, retrieval
and aggregation of the feature.

## Computing features
The `FeatureHandler` defines a `compute` function which must be on the form:
```
compute = function(start_date, end_date, slice_ts, source_conn)
```
The arguments `start_date` and `end_date` indicates the period for which features should be computed.
The `diseasystores` are [dynamically expanded](diseasystore.html#dynamically-expanded), so feature computation is often
restricted to limited time intervals as indicated by `start_date` and `end_date`.

As mentioned [above](#from_ts-and-until_ts) `slice_ts` specifies what date the should be computed for.
E.g. if `slice_ts` is the current date, the current features should be computed.
Conversely, if `slice_ts` is some past date, features corresponding to this date should be computed.

Lastly, the `source_conn` is a flexible argument passed to the `FeatureHandler` indicating where the source data needed
to compute the features are stored (e.g. a data base connection or directory).

Note that multiple features can be computed by a single `FeatureHandler`.
For example, you may decide that it is more convenient for compute multiple different features simultaneously
(e.g. a hospitalisation and the classification of said hospitalisation or a test and the associated test result).

## Retrieving features
The `FeatureHandler` defines a `get` function which must be on the form:
```
get = function(target_table, slice_ts, target_conn)
```
Typically, you do not need to specify this function since the default (a variant of `SCDB::get_table()`) always works.

However, in the case that you do need to specify it, the `target_table` argument will be a `DBI::Id` specifying the
location of the data base table where the features are stored.
`target_conn` is connection to the data base.
And as above, `slice_ts` is the time-keeping variable.

## Aggregators
The `FeatureHandler` defines a `key_join` function which must be on the form:
```
key_join = function(.data, feature)
```

In most cases, you should be able to use the bundled `key_join_*` functions (see `?aggregators` for a full list).

In the event, that you need to create your own aggregator the arguments are as follows:

* `.data` is a grouped `data.frame` whose groups are those specified by the `stratification` argument
  (see [Automatic aggregation](diseasystore.html#automatic-aggregation)).

* `feature` is the name of the feature(s) to aggregate.

Your aggregator should return a `dplyr::summarise()` call which operates on all columns specified in the `feature`
argument.


## Putting it all together
By now, you should know the basics of creating your own `FeatureHandlers`.
To see some `FeatureHandlers` in action, you can consult a few of those bundled with the `diseasystore` package.

For example:

* [DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19: index](https://github.com/ssi-dk/diseasystore/blob/ceedbe1/R/DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19.R#L161)

* [DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19: min temperature](https://github.com/ssi-dk/diseasystore/blob/ceedbe1/R/DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19.R#L253)


# Creating a `diseasystore`
With the knowledge of how to build custom `FeatureHandlers`, we turn our attention to the remaining parts of the
`diseasystore`'s anatomy.

The `diseasystores` are [R6 classes](https://r6.r-lib.org/index.html) which is a implementation of object-oriented (OO)
programming.
To those unfamiliar with OO programming, the `diseasystores` are single "objects" with a number of "public" and
"private" functions and variables.
The public functions and variables are visible to the user of the `diseasystore` with the private functions and
variables are visible only to us (the developers).

When extending `diseasystore`, we are only writing private functions and variables.
The public functions and variables are handled elsewhere[^4].

## ds_map
The `ds_map` field of the `diseasystore` tells the `diseasystore` which `FeatureHandler` is responsible for each feature
 and thus allows the `diseasystore` to retrieve the features specified in the `observable` and `stratification`
 arguments of calls to `$get_feature()`.

In other words, it maps the names of features to their corresponding `FeatureHandlers`.

As we saw above, a `FeatureHandler` may compute more than single feature. Each feature should be mapped to the
`FeatureHandler` here or else the `diseasystore` will not be able to automatically interact with it.

By convention, the name of the `FeatureHandler` should be snake_case and contain a `diseasystore` specific prefix
(e.g. for `DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19`, all `FeatureHandlers` are named "google_covid_19_<feature>").

These names are used as the table names when storing the features in the data base, and the prefix helps structure the
data base accordingly.

This latter part becomes important when [clean up](diseasystore.html#dropping-computed-features) for the data base needs
to be performed.

## Key join filter
The `diseasystore` are made to be as flexible as possible which means that it can incorporate both individual level
data and semi-aggregated data.
For semi-aggregated data, it is often the case that the data includes aggregations at different levels nested within
the data.

For example, the Google COVID-19 data repository contains information on both country-level and region-level in the
same data files.
When the user of `DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19` asks to get a feature stratified by, for example, "country_id", then we
need to filter out the data aggregated at the region-level.

This is the purpose of `$key_join_filter()`. It takes as input the requested stratifications and filters the data
accordingly after the features have been joined inside the `diseasystore`.

For an example, you can consult [DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19: key_join_filter](https://github.com/ssi-dk/diseasystore/blob/ceedbe1/R/DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19.R#L75)

## Testing your `diseasystore`
The `diseasystore` package includes a large set of tests for `DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19` that you can adapt to your
custom `diseasystore`. The latest version of these tests are available [here](https://github.com/ssi-dk/diseasystore/blob/main/tests/testthat/test-DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19.R).

[^1]: The `SCDB` package places `checksum`, `from_ts`, and `until_ts` as the last columns. But `valid_from` and
      `valid_until` should be the last columns in the output passed to `SCDB`.
[^2]: In practice, this means that the names of features should be in `snake_case`.
[^3]: Or "coupled" set of features as we will soon see.
[^4]: By the `DiseasystoreBase` class.
