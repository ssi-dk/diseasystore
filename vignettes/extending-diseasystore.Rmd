This vignette gives you the knowledge you need to create your own `diseasystore`.

Once you have familiarised yourself with the concepts, you can consult the `vignette("extending-diseasystore-example")`,
where we go through how a individual-level `diseasystore` can be implemented.

# The diseasy data model
To begin, we go through the data model used within the `diseasystores`.
It is this data model that enables the automatic coupling of features and powers the package.

## A bitemporal data model
The data created by `diseasystores` are so-called "bitemporal" data.
This means we have two temporal dimensions.
One representing the validity of the record, and one representing the availability of the record.

### `valid_from` and `valid_until`
The validity dimension indicates when a given data point is "valid", e.g. a hospitalisation is valid between admission
and discharge date.
This temporal dimension should be familiar to you is simply "regular" time.

We encode the validity information into the columns `valid_from` and `valid_until` such that a record is valid for any
time `t` which satisfies `valid_from <= t < valid_until`.
For many features, the validity is a single day (such as a test result) and the `valid_until` column will be the day
after `valid_from`.

By convention, we place these column as the last columns of the table[^1].

### `from_ts` and `until_ts`
`diseasystore` uses `{SCDB}` in the background to store the computed features.
`SCDB` implements the second temporal dimension which indicates when a record was present in the data.
This information is encoded in the columns `from_ts` and `until_ts`.
Normally, you don't see these columns when working with `diseasystore` since they are masked by `SCDB`.
However, if you inspect the tables created in the database by diseasystore, you will find they are present.
For our purposes, it is sufficient to know that these column gives a time-versioned data base where we can extract
previous versions through the `slice_ts` argument.
By supplying any time `Ï„` as `slice_ts`, we get the data as they were available on that date.
This allows us to build continuous integration of our features while preserving previously computed features.


## Automatic data-coupling
A primary feature of `diseasystore` is its ability to automatically couple and aggregate features.
This coupling requires common "key_\*" columns between the features.
Any feature in a `diseasystore` therefore must have at least one "key_\*" column.
By convention, we place these column as the first columns of the table.

## Features
Finally, we come to the main data of the `diseasystore`, namely the features.
First, a reminder that "feature" here comes from machine learning and is any individual piece of information.

We subdivide features into two categories: "observables" and "stratifications".
On most levels, these are indistinguishable, but their purposes differ and hence we need to handle them individually.

To see the available features of a `diseasystore`, you can use the `$available_features()` method.

### Observables
In `diseasystore` any feature whose name starts with "n_" is treated as "observables" (by default).
For specific `diseasystores`, the naming convention may differ.
From a modelling perspective, these observables are typically the metrics you want to model or take as inputs to inform
your model.

To see the available observables in a `diseasystore`, you can use the `$available_observables()` method.

### Stratifications
Conversely, any other feature is a "stratification" feature.
These features are the variables used to subdivide your analysis to match the structure of your model
(hence why they are called stratification features).

A prominent example for most disease models would be a stratification feature like "age_group", since most diseases
show a strong dependency on the age of the affected individuals.

To see the available observables in a `diseasystore`, you can use the `$available_stratifications()` method.

### Naming convention
While there is no formal requirement for the naming of the observables or stratifications, it is considered best
practice to use the same names as other `diseasystores` for features where possible[^2].
This simplifies the process of adapting analyses and disease models to new `diseasystores`.

# Creating FeatureHandlers
To facilitate the automatic coupling and aggregation of features, we use the `?FeatureHandler` class.
Each feature[^3] in the `diseasystore` has an associated `FeatureHandler` which implements the computation, retrieval
and aggregation of the feature.

## Computing features
The `FeatureHandler` defines a `$compute()` function which must be on the form:
```
compute = function(start_date, end_date, slice_ts, source_conn, ...)
```
The arguments `start_date` and `end_date` indicates the period for which features should be computed.
The `diseasystores` are [dynamically expanded](diseasystore.html#dynamically-expanded), so feature computation is often
restricted to limited time intervals as indicated by `start_date` and `end_date`.

As mentioned [above](#from_ts-and-until_ts) `slice_ts` specifies what date the should be computed for.
E.g. if `slice_ts` is the current date, the current features should be computed.
Conversely, if `slice_ts` is some past date, features corresponding to this date should be computed.

Lastly, the source_conn is a flexible argument passed to the FeatureHandler indicating where the source data needed to
compute the features is stored (e.g. a database connection or directory).

Note that multiple features can be computed by a single `FeatureHandler`.
For example, you may decide that it is more convenient for compute multiple different features simultaneously
(e.g. a hospitalisation and the classification of said hospitalisation or a test and the associated test result).

When `$compute()` is called by the `diseasystore`, it also passes a reference to itself as `ds` via the `...` argument.
This means that if the implementation of `$compute()` needs access to other features to compute the given feature,
the compute function can pick up the `ds` reference adding it to the function signature:
```
compute = function(start_date, end_date, slice_ts, source_conn, ds, ...)
```
And then use `ds$get_feature(<feature>, start_date = start_date, end_date = end_date, slice_ts = slice_ts)` to retrieve
the necessary features for the computation.

## Retrieving features
The `FeatureHandler` defines a `$get()` function which must be in the form:
```
get = function(target_table, slice_ts, target_conn)
```
Typically, you do not need to specify this function since the default (a variant of `SCDB::get_table()`) always works.

However, in the case that you do need to specify it, the `target_table` argument will be a `DBI::Id` specifying the
location of the data base table where the features are stored.
`target_conn` is connection to the database.
And as above, `slice_ts` is the time-keeping variable.

## Aggregators
The `FeatureHandler` defines a `key_join` function which must be on the form:
```
key_join = function(.data, feature)
```

In most cases, you should be able to use the bundled `key_join_*` functions (see `?aggregators` for a full list).

In the event, that you need to create your own aggregator the arguments are as follows:

* `.data` is a grouped `data.frame` whose groups are those specified by the `stratification` argument
  (see [Automatic aggregation](diseasystore.html#automatic-aggregation)).

* `feature` is the name of the feature(s) to aggregate.

Your aggregator should return a `dplyr::summarise()` call that operates on all columns specified in the `feature`
argument.


## Putting it all together
By now, you should know the basics of creating your own `FeatureHandlers`.

To see some `FeatureHandlers` in action, you can consult a few of those bundled with the `diseasystore` package.

For example:

* [DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19: index](https://github.com/ssi-dk/diseasystore/blob/ceedbe1/R/DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19.R#L161)

* [DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19: min temperature](https://github.com/ssi-dk/diseasystore/blob/ceedbe1/R/DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19.R#L253)


# Creating a `diseasystore`
With the knowledge of how to build custom `FeatureHandlers`, we turn our attention to the remaining parts of the
`diseasystore`'s anatomy.

The `diseasystores` are [R6 classes](https://r6.r-lib.org/index.html) which is a implementation of object-oriented (OO)
programming.
To those unfamiliar with OO programming, the `diseasystores` are single "objects" with a number of "public" and
"private" functions and variables.
The public functions and variables are visible to the user of the `diseasystore` with the private functions and
variables are visible only to us (the developers).

When extending `diseasystore`, we are only writing private functions and variables.
The public functions and variables are handled elsewhere[^4].

## ds_map
The `ds_map` field of the `diseasystore` tells the `diseasystore` which `FeatureHandler` is responsible for each
feature, thus allowing the `diseasystore` to retrieve the features specified in the `observable` and `stratification`
arguments of calls to `$get_feature()`.

In other words, it maps the names of features to their corresponding `FeatureHandlers`.

As we saw above, a `FeatureHandler` may compute more than a single feature. Each feature should be mapped to the
`FeatureHandler` here or else the `diseasystore` will not be able to automatically interact with it.

By convention, the name of the `FeatureHandler` should be snake_case and contain a `diseasystore` specific prefix
(e.g. for `DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19`, all `FeatureHandlers` are named "google_covid_19_<feature>").

These names are used as the table names when storing the features in the database, and the prefix helps structure the
database accordingly.

This latter part becomes important when [clean up](diseasystore.html#dropping-computed-features) for the data base needs
to be performed.

By default, any feature whose name starts with "n_" is treated as an observable feature. To override this behaviour,
you can specify the regex pattern `$observables_regex` to match the names of the observable features in your case.

## Key join filter
The `diseasystore` are made to be as flexible as possible which means that it can incorporate both individual level
data and semi-aggregated data.
For semi-aggregated data, it is often the case that the data includes aggregations at different levels, nested within
the data.

For example, the Google COVID-19 data repository contains information on both country-level and region-level in the
same data files.
When the user of `DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19` asks to get a feature stratified by, for example, "country_id", we
need to filter out the data aggregated at the region level.

This is the purpose of `$key_join_filter()`. It takes as input the requested stratifications and filters the data
accordingly after the features have been joined inside the `diseasystore`.

For an example, you can consult [DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19: key_join_filter](https://github.com/ssi-dk/diseasystore/blob/ceedbe1/R/DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19.R#L75)

## Testing your `diseasystore`
The `diseasystore` package includes the function `test_diseasystore()` to test the `diseasystores`.
You can see how to call the testing suite in action with `DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19` as an example [here](https://github.com/ssi-dk/diseasystore/blob/main/tests/testthat/test-DiseasystoreGoogleCovid19.R).

## Exposing the period of data availability
To allow the `diseasystores` to be used programmatically, we expose the period of data availability for each
`diseasystore`. These are defined in the `$.min_start_date` and `$.max_end_date` private fields of the `diseasystore`.

## Limiting support for some database backends
In some cases, the `diseasystores` may not be compatible with all database backends.

In this case, we add a check to the `initialize` method of the `diseasystore` to ensure that the database backend is
compatible with the `diseasystore`.
```
  initialize = function(...) {
    super$initialize(...)

    # We do not support SQLite for this diseasystore since it has poor support for date operations
    checkmate::assert_disjunct(class(self$target_conn), "SQLiteConnection")

    ...
  }
```

[^1]: The `SCDB` package places `checksum`, `from_ts`, and `until_ts` as the last columns. But `valid_from` and
      `valid_until` should be the last columns in the output passed to `SCDB`.
[^2]: In practice, this means that the names of features should be in `snake_case`.
[^3]: Or "coupled" set of features as we will soon see.
[^4]: By the `DiseasystoreBase` class.
