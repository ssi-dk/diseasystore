## Overview

The `diseasystore` package provides feature stores implemented in R specifically designed for serve disease data for epidemic preparedness.

What makes a `diseasystore` special, is that features can be automatically coupled and stratified within the `diseasystore` package. Consult the Quick start vignette to see it in action (`vignette("quick-start", package = "diseasystore")`).

The package forms the data-backbone of the `{diseasy}` package.

## Handling of diverse data sources
Different data sources are handled by individual `diseasystores` which each facilitate access to the relevant disease data for the given data source.

Data for different diseases will typically be structured in different ways. The `diseasystore` package currently implements the Google Health COVID-19 Open Repository with more one `diseasystores` the way.

The `diseasystore` package is designed to handled both individual-level data (examples to come) and semi-aggregated (typically publicly available) data.

If the data is at the individual-level, the feature store is fully dynamic and can adapt to (virtually) any stratification that the user specifies.
If the data conversely is semi-aggregated, the data can only be stratified at the levels of the semi-aggregation (or at higher levels).

## Installation
