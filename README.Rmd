## Overview
Leveraging combinatorial building for ensemble forecasting in disease modelling

## The power of combinations
`diseasy` is framework for disease modelling that is built around the philosophy of combinatorial building.
Even from a small number of modules, an ensemble consisting of a vast array of disease models can be constructed by combining individual modules.

## The power of ensembles
Ensemble models of disease spread typically outperforms individual models in terms of robust and accurate forecasts.
With `diseasy`, ensemble models are leveraged to support evidence-based decision-making and pandemic preparedness.

## Installation
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install diseasystore from CRAN:
install.packages("diseasystore")

# Alternatively, install the development version from github:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ssi-dk/diseasystore")
```

## Usage
For basic usage examples, see `vignette("quick-start")`.
